<p>Serious health conditions, caring for a loved one, or welcoming a new child should not cost you your job. Federal and state laws provide strong protections for eligible employees who need time away from work. If you believe your employer interfered with your leave rights or retaliated against you, consulting with an experienced <a href="https://www.cmlaw.com/new-jersey-employment-law-firm/fmla-nj-discrimination-lawyers/">Employment Lawyer</a> can help you understand your options.</p>

<p>Castronovo &amp; McKinney, LLC focuses exclusively on employment law and represents employees throughout New Jersey in leave-related disputes. From its Morristown office, the firm serves clients across Bergen County, Essex County, Middlesex County, Morris County, and surrounding communities with strategic, client-centered advocacy.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)</h2>

<p>The federal Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave within a 12-month period for qualifying reasons. These may include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A serious personal health condition</li>
	<li>Caring for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition</li>
	<li>The birth, adoption, or foster placement of a child</li>
	<li>Certain military family-related circumstances</li>
</ul>

<p>Employees who qualify for FMLA leave are entitled to return to the same or an equivalent position with the same pay, benefits, and working conditions.</p>

<h2>New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA)</h2>

<p>The New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA) provides additional protections under state law. While it overlaps with the FMLA in some areas, the NJFLA focuses primarily on leave to care for family members and bonding with a new child, rather than personal medical leave.</p>

<p>Eligibility requirements differ slightly between the two laws, and understanding how they interact is essential when evaluating potential claims.</p>

<h2>Interference with Leave Rights</h2>

<p>Employers are prohibited from interfering with, restraining, or denying employees&rsquo; lawful use of protected leave. Interference may occur when an employer:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fails to inform employees of their leave rights</li>
	<li>Discourages employees from taking leave</li>
	<li>Denies valid leave requests without justification</li>
	<li>Misclassifies leave in a way that reduces available time</li>
</ul>

<p>When interference occurs, employees may have grounds for legal action even if they were not formally terminated.</p>

<h2>Retaliation After Taking Leave</h2>

<p>Both federal and state law prohibit employers from retaliating against employees for taking protected leave. Retaliation may include termination, demotion, reduction in hours, negative performance reviews, or reassignment to less favorable positions.</p>

<p>Timing often plays a key role in these cases. For example, if an employee is terminated shortly after returning from approved leave, careful legal analysis may reveal whether the decision was retaliatory.</p>

<h2>Damages in FMLA and NJFLA Claims</h2>

<p>Employees who successfully pursue claims under the FMLA or NJFLA may recover:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Back pay for lost wages</li>
	<li>Front pay for future lost income</li>
	<li>Restoration of lost benefits</li>
	<li>Attorneys&rsquo; fees and court costs</li>
	<li>In certain cases, liquidated damages under federal law</li>
</ul>

<p>Prompt legal consultation helps preserve evidence and ensures compliance with applicable filing deadlines.</p>

<h2>Employer Compliance and Documentation</h2>

<p>Employers must provide appropriate notices regarding leave rights and maintain accurate documentation. Misunderstandings about medical certifications, eligibility thresholds, and overlapping leave periods can create legal exposure.</p>

<p>Castronovo &amp; McKinney carefully reviews employer policies, communications, and personnel records to determine whether statutory obligations were met.</p>

<h2>Focused Advocacy for New Jersey Employees</h2>

<p>Leave disputes often arise during emotionally and physically stressful times. Having experienced legal guidance can provide clarity and stability when you need it most. Castronovo &amp; McKinney prepares each case with meticulous attention to detail, whether pursuing resolution through negotiation or litigation.</p>

<p>Protecting your right to take legally protected leave helps safeguard not only your current employment but also your long-term career and financial security.</p>
